      Mattermost offers a RESTful Web Service API for interacting with the server. This document acts as a reference for version 3 of that API. For other documentation please see https://docs.mattermost.com.

      If you would like to contribute to this reference, we accept pull requests at https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference.

    description: All API access is through HTTP(S) requests at `your-mattermost-url.com/api/v3`. All request and response bodies are `application/json`.
  - name: drivers
    description: |
      The easiest way to interact with the Mattermost Web Service API is through a language specific driver. These can be found at the following links:
      
      * [Mattermost JavaScript Driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-driver-javascript)
      * [Mattermost Golang Driver](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/blob/master/model/client.go)
      
      For an example usage of the Golang driver, please see the [Golang Bot Sample](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-bot-sample-golang).
    
  - name: authentication
    description: |
      The majority of the Mattermost API involves interacting with teams. Therefore, most API methods require authentication as a user. There are two ways to authenticate into a Mattermost system.
      
      All examples assume there is a Mattermost instance running at http://localhost:8065.
      
      #### Session Token
      
      Make an HTTP POST to `your-mattermost-url.com/api/v3/users/login` with a JSON body indicating the name of the team, the user’s `login_id`, `password` and optionally the MFA `token`. The `login_id` can be an email, username or an AD/LDAP ID depending on the system's configuration.
      
      ```
      curl -i -d '{"login_id":"someone@nowhere.com","password":"thisisabadpassword"}' http://localhost:8065/api/v3/users/login
      ```
      
      If successful, the response will contain a `Token` header and a user object in the body.
      
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Set-Cookie: MMSID=hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly
      Token: hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso
      X-Ratelimit-Limit: 10
      X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 9
      X-Ratelimit-Reset: 1
      X-Request-Id: smda55ckcfy89b6tia58shk5fh
      X-Version-Id: developer
      Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:21:14 GMT
      Content-Length: 657
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      {{user object as json}}
      ```
      
      Include the `Token` as part of the `Authentication` header on your future API requests with the `Bearer` method.
      
      ```
      curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso' http://localhost:8065/api/v3/users/me
      ```
      
      You should now be able to access the API as the user you logged in as.
      
      #### OAuth 2.0
      
      Mattermost has the ability to act as an [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) service provider.
      
      For an example on how to register an OAuth 2.0 app with your Mattermost instance, please see the [Mattermost-Zapier integration documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/zapier.html#register-zapier-as-an-oauth-2-0-application).
      
      Additional documentation on using Mattermost as an OAuth 2.0 service provider will be added here in the future.
  - name: errors
    description: |
      All errors will return an appropriate HTTP response code along with the following JSON body:
      ```
      {
          "id": "the.error.id",
          "message": "Something went wrong", // the reason for the error
          "request_id": "", // the ID of the request
          "status_code": 0, // the HTTP status code
          "is_oauth": false // whether the error is OAuth specific
      }
      ```
  - name: rate limiting
    description: |
      Whenever you make an HTTP request to the Mattermost API you might notice the following headers included in the response:
      ```
      X-Ratelimit-Limit: 10
      X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 9
      X-Ratelimit-Reset: 1441983590
      ```
      
      These headers are telling you your current rate limit status.
      
      | Header | Description |
      | ------ | ----------- |
      | X-Ratelimit-Limit | The maximum number of requests you can make per second. |
      | X-Ratelimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current window. |
      | X-Ratelimit-Reset | The remaining UTC epoch seconds before the rate limit resets. |
      
      If you exceed your rate limit for a window you will receive the following error in the body of the response:
      
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
      Date: Tue, 10 Sep 2015 11:20:28 GMT
      X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
      X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
      X-RateLimit-Reset: 1
      
      limit exceeded
