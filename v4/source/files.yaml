        This request can either be a multipart/form-data request with a channel_id, files and optional

        client_ids defined in the FormData, or it can be a request with the channel_id and filename

        defined as query parameters with the contents of a single file in the body of the request.


        Only multipart/form-data requests are supported by server versions up to and including 4.7.

        Server versions 4.8 and higher support both types of requests.
